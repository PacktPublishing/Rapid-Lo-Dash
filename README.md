# Rapid-Lo-Dash
This is the code repository for [Rapid Lo-Dash [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/rapid-lo-dash-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Lo-Dash is a library that lets JavaScript developers do more with less code. It can be used in node.js applications or in web apps and provides an essential utility belt for coding. Its lightweight, high-performance functions can make it easier to add functional programming concepts to nearly any application. However, getting started can be intimidating, so this video course introduces you to functional programming with Lo-Dash so you can start writing code without getting bogged down in theory.

Rapid Lo-Dash is a fast-paced introduction to using functional programming techniques in JavaScript.

You will start by setting up your development environment, and get your feet wet using Lo-Dash to work with arrays. Then you'll use Lo-Dash to work with JavaScript Objects and Types. You will then do some exercises to explore object keys and values, and duplicate objects and values. Then you will learn to create collections, extract data from them, and manipulate them. Once you've seen the building blocks of Lo-Dash, you'll use functional programming techniques to write applications that you'll love to maintain. Finally you’ll learn to use chaining and control the flow of your app.

By the time you've completed Rapid Lo-Dash, you'll have seen how Lo-Dash can help you write fast and maintainable JavaScript applications for node.js or the Web.
